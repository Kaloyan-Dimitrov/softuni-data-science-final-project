# How is the public opinion about a company correlated to it's market value?

A company's market value is variable and depends on a lot of factors. The price is a reflection of the company's perceived value - what the public is willing to pay for a piece of the company. It can and will rise and fall, based on a variety of factors in the global landscape and within the company itself. One of which is becoming more influential than ever - people's opinion on social media.

To analyze this correlation we'll look at two datasets. The first one contains over 3 million unique tweets with their information such as tweet id, author of the tweet, post date, the text body of the tweet, and the number of comments, likes, and retweets of tweets matched with the related company.

The second one will just have daily stock price records (from the Forbes2000) for us to make a reference with.
